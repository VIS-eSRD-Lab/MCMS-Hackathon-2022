In this problem, you have to implement a Book Shop Invoice by the instruction provided in the tasks.
 
## Guidelines:
### Hackathon (10:30 a.m - 2:30 p.m)  Times: 4 hours
1. This problem has 2 tasks.
2. Use this code base for solving the problem. 
3. Make a commit after you complete a task. You must submit your solution by pushing all your commits to your branch ( branchname will be your Intern ID ) on Git Repository at the end of the hackathon.
4. Evaluation is independent for all. But plagiarism is prohibited, so solve it on your own. If you are caught plagiarism, we may disqualify your test. 
5. You can access all offline and online resources to solve the problem.

### Submission:
```diff

+ Commit and Push your work on the branch that you have created.
```

### N.B:
```diff
- After the hackathon, everyone must present his/her work in the zoom meeting.
- The meeting will be always open on this day so that you can ask questions at any time.
```
